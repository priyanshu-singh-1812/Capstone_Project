# Analysis on Emerging Technology Skills and Trends

Project Description:
As a Data Analyst at a leading global IT and business consulting firm, this project involves a comprehensive analysis of the top programming skills in demand. The initiative begins with the collection of data from diverse sources such as job postings, training portals, and surveys. Using web scraping techniques and accessing APIs, data is gathered in various formats, including CSV files, Excel sheets, and databases.

The next phase involves making the data analysis-ready through rigorous data wrangling techniques. This prepared data is then subjected to statistical analysis to uncover key insights and trends, such as the most in-demand programming languages, top database skills, and popular IDEs.

Leveraging IBM Cognos Analytics, an interactive dashboard is created to visualize the findings, providing a dynamic tool for exploring the data. The project culminates in a compelling presentation that effectively communicates the insights and trends identified, showcasing advanced storytelling skills and enabling strategic decision-making based on the latest data on emerging IT skills.
